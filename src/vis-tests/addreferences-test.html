                      page similar to this at Hoptroff for several graphing
                      libraries, but that is company source. The first render of
                      this graph only took a short while; I am focussing on
                      branding things not on the data; which is why I used data
                      from the library documentation.

                        Highcharts is another library that builds SVG graphs, so
                        they are fairly easy to style and encourage to be
                        responsive. As I have quickly built this demo, and I
                        don't think this code was hard or impressive. I don't
                        perceive risk in starting a role that uses this graph
                        library rather than the one I used at Hoptroff. <br />
                        As a second feature on the demo; as far as I can see all
                        the animation effects are just applying the data that
                        you already have onto the screen

                        traditional solution using setIntervail(), or another

                          Highcharts is mostly just a graphing library in JS, so
                          will score low on my standardised feature comparison

                          data-source for highcharts; I cannot see anything that
                          lets you build highcharts graphs from the python
                          interpreter. Highcharts is fairly mature and currently

                          to why use the API; I guess if your output is
                          presented on a small phone, creating the graphs on
                          static/ fixed power supply is better experience. It
                          would be cheaper to use Node on your own server; then
                          render and save the graphs as static assets. All my
                          work involving graphs has been dynamic data, or least
                          fairly-short shelf-life data; so managing caching on
                          the static assets would be important.

                          As a graphing library, Highcharts only supports
                          graphs; but can be used with any DB if you create some
                          middleware. Highcharts has plugin support, and a list
                          of user created plugins

                          ) Highcharts can create dashboards; the tools blog has
                          a PNG of a dashboard but no blurb, so I don't think
                          this a feature that they emphasise.

                          Highcharts doesn't export alerts; but you could access
                          the render cycle, and create your own

                          data architecture. Highcharts doesn't have monitoring
                          features, but can be used for monitoring. Various
