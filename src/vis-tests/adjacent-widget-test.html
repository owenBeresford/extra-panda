                  <li>
                    This is source generated by TS in this same repo. This is a
                    list of links.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The articles are grouped, and the list is the current offset
                    of the current group (so every article gets a different
                    adjacent material)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This was designed for tablets, and so I wanted a clear
                    marker for 'you can thumb here' ~ plain foundation button
                    class.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I made a fancy tooltip, as I have the meta data (my
                    content), but its fairly irrelevant. I like the idea that
                    even if my titles aren't brilliant that the surrounding data
                    means that user can see where they go, so only get good data
                    for their goals. After I made this feature, I developed a
                    process to improve my titles... :-)
                  </li>
                  <li>The newer edition only renders a number of links.</li>
                  <li>
                    The first link will be the group index link, this is
                    repeated on the extreme tail of the list.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There is an auto-code group intro/ label. This is clear and
                    fairly short.
