The following URL should be looked at for manual tests.
I could automatically open the tabs,
 but think that would be annoying if you only want to look at 1 file

These URLs below are running when either of the following is run:
` node tools/test-browser.mjs --visual-tests-only `
OR
` node ./node_modules/.bin/vite-node tools/test-browser.ts --visual-tests-only `
