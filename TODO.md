### Previous Updates

- Discuss: Perl-style encapsulation by culture rather than armed enforcers.
- Discuss: Every time I am setting CSS vis JS, this is code smell & I need more information.
- Discuss: Whilst checking old security failures, note that JS modules segregates the '90s and '00s from my website JS.  It implies "use strict" flag as a further layer of less-stupid.
- DONE: Last month I learned the terser doesn't strip all line breaks, as that stops the map files working.  My initial terser setup is running as expected.   Terser reduces volume ~50KB -> 30KB.  I can over apply uglify to prod builds, which strips a further ~7KB of line breaks

- DONE adjacent links no longer erase first group label when there is multiple adjacent groups.
- DONE made it more clear that the 10 items in the adjacent list are not the full list, but a browser width option.
- WONTFIX A legacy version of JS that **can't read JS modules** may be breached if someone overloads window.Array, and parses JSON. ["AJAX security tips" https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/AJAX_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html] ["Historic JSON parsing problems" https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/159609/how-is-it-possible-to-poison-javascript-array-constructor-and-how-does-ecmascrip]
